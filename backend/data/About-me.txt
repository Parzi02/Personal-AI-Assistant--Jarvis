💻 Your Projects

BidProHub

A project you’re developing with HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS on the frontend, and Express.js for the backend.

You’ve also used PHP for authentication and integrated pre-existing HTML pages.

You’ve discussed difficulties and features related to this project.

AI Voice Assistant

A major project that integrates React (frontend), Python (backend), Firebase (database), and AI/NLP features.

Includes speech recognition, NLP, and text-to-speech functionalities.

You’ve described it as interactive, user-friendly, and capable of performing system tasks and responding to queries.

LLM + Vector Database Project (Diligent)

You’re working on a local LLM project using Ollama, Pinecone (vector database), and FastAPI backend.

You’ve explored RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) setups with LLaMA models, and asked about model paths, installation steps, and integration processes.

The project seems inspired by Diligent or connected to your internship interest in AI Agentic systems.

🧠 Your Interests

You’re passionate about AI, machine learning, NLP, and voice-based interfaces.

You’re interested in Agentic AI, RAG, MCP servers, and how these are applied in enterprise-level systems.

You like to understand systems deeply — you often ask for complete step-by-step guides instead of surface-level explanations.

You enjoy building full-stack AI applications and exploring modern frameworks like React, FastAPI, and Tailwind.

🎯 Your Goals & Learning Style

You’re focused on building real-world AI-powered products.

You prefer hands-on, structured learning — guides that include setup, code, and explanation.

You often combine AI, web development, and backend systems — showing a strong interest in end-to-end system design.

You’ve also asked for internship statements and project descriptions — suggesting you’re preparing for internships or placements.

Sohan loves Indu.
